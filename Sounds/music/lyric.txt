Title: Neon Dreams
Genre: synthwave,  retro,  electronic

[Verse]
Neon lights they flicker bright
In the city of the night
We’re cruising through electric haze
Living fast in future's gaze

[Verse 2]
Glowing signs above the streets
Where the past and future meet
Holograms and cyber sound
We’re lost until we're found

[Chorus]
In this neon dream so wild
Running free just like a child
Through the circuits of our mind
In this place where time's confined

[Verse 3]
Skyways filled with flying cars
Digital skies and virtual stars
Artificial hearts will beat
